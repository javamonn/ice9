Coinciding with the release of [Android 5.0, Lollipop](http://www.android.com/versions/lollipop-5-0/), Google has engineered the [Material Design](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) paradigm, a monolithic UX philosophy that aims to simplify and enlighten digital interactions. It has been met with mixed reactions within the design community, largely because it violates a lot of previously well established and unquestioned trends in interface and application design.

One important fact of Material has been largely unrecognized, that is, it is actually nothing new. Material itself is merely a formalized system, the core ideas that compose it have been employed by content creators in domains such as music, architecture, and literature with considerable success over the last century. These ideas applied within the context user experience are an entirely new idea and have the potential to be paradigm shifting, but it's important to realize that Material simply packages tried and tested tools and philosophies with the intent of applying them to a new problem domain.

In order to elucidate this fact, I will focus on drawing parallels between the music of one such content creator, The American Jazz pianist [Thelonious Sphere Monk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelonious_Monk), and some of the design strategies encompassed by Google's Material. Monk is my choice used simply because I am familiar with his work, this is not to mean he is responsible for inception of these ideas. One could have just as easiy used the architect [Frank Lloyd Wright](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Lloyd_Wright) or the poet [E. E. Cummings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._E._Cummings) as their origin and ended up with some meaningful comparisons.

The goal is to enable a better understanding and appreciation of the core philosophies of Material Design, and maybe, in turn, the music of Thelonious Monk.

#Colorful Dissonance

One of the core themes of Material is the unorthodox use of color, encouraging jarring color juxtopositions. Take a look at two of the samples given in the documentation:
</div>

<div layout="horizontal" layout-align="space-around" class="image-container" id="material-plates">
	<img ng-src="{{ getAssetsUrl() + 'material-color-1.png' }}" />
	<img ng-src="{{ getAssetsUrl() + 'material-color-2.png' }}" />
</div>

One immediately notices that the use of color in these two plates stands out and feels wrong, unconventional. No "rational" designer would ever use a yellow accent on a black background or strand a bright cyan fab button out tying it back into the app's color scheme. But still, even though it breaks the rules, something about this use of color jumps at you and captures your attention. The word for this phenomenon is ***dissonance***.

> dissonance
> n.
>	1. A harsh, disagreeable combination of sounds; discord.
>	2. Lack of agreement, consistancy, or harmony; conflict.

If you google ["dissonance"](https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=dissonance),  you'll learn that even though the word has its origins in late Middle English, it sees a dramatic increase in usage in the late 1950's through the 1960's, and its is safe to say that Bebop holds a large share of the responsibility for that.

Bebop was a style of Jazz that was based on improvising around pre arranged chord changes. Bebop was a loose categorization for musicians like [John Coltrane](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Coltrane), [Miles Davis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Davis]), and Thelonious Monk, all of which sought musical liberation from the crowd pleasing, dancable music produced by the popular swing style jazz bands of the 1930's. For the majority of Bebop musicians, this meant blazing tempos and intricate solos; For Monk it meant chordal dissonances, and ergonomic minimalism.

As a good example of Monk's approach to the piano, take a moment to consider this recording of his composition "Off Minor".

Without a doubt, the piano in Monk's hands seems to be a distant cousin of the piano in the hands of classical composers like Chopin or even the piano heard in modern American pop music. The culpit for this distance lies in Monk's liberal use of dissonance, the use of chords and notes you did not expect to hear in the places that you did not expect to hear them.

> Monk preferred descending chromatic chord progressions and dissonant "open-voiced" chords made up of just the root and the seventh or ninth degree of the scale. His chords often elicited chuckles from the audiance, but Monk didn't mind. Monk's chords were a product of years of training, experimentation, and a solid understanding of music theory. Monk knew it, which is why he became so annoyed when critics, musicians, or fans - even the sympathetic ones - described his chords as "wrong" or "weird".

Music theory aside, Monk employed musical dissonance for largely the same reason Material encourages color dissonance - by surprising your audiance, you capture their undivided attention, and create a memory of the experience. In the case of Monk, dissonance forced you to really listen and reconstruct the song's original theme in your mind. In the case of Material, dissonance forced you to identify the important parts of the user interface. Suprising someone, irrespective of the domain in which you do it, will always captivate your audiance. 

Material's use of dissonance goes as far as to elevate the role of color within design to the degree of being semantic. That is, the color of a component implies some meaning. If you refer to the original two sample plates shown earlier, you notice that you can immediately infer that the yellow slider has some importance, and for the other plate, that the cyan fab button is critical to the interaction of that activity, and that other components are less important. You can infer this from the color of those components alone, without any other knowledge of what these applications do.

This concept is antithetical to the use of color as we know it in modern web and application design, which places inordinate importance on minimizing color contrast in flat designs. The landing pages of [Stripe](https://stripe.com/), [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) and even [Apple](http://www.apple.com/) all fall victim to this trend. Examples within the worlds of iOS and Android are abundant. Font colors are difficult to read on their background and component colors are monochrome and do not signify any importance.

Admittedly, utilizing color dissonance is, by its very nature, uncomfortable to do. It feels like you're breaking fundamental rules of design, and in some perspectives, you are. It's a gut feeling to get it right and easily taken too far into disjointed chaos. The influence of all the sterile and low contrast sites we use on a daily basis are subtly imprinted on our subconcious, and manifested in our work. The one advantage that we have, and that Monk didn't, is the knowledge, the evidence and retrospect, that dissonance is effective as a creative tool.

# Ergonomic Minimalism

Another core philosophy of Material Design is the idea of reducing interface clutter and unneeded components ( interface "chrome") to just what is necessary to enable fundamental purpose of that particular interface. This concept is referenced in the Material Design documents as "deliberate whitespace", but I feel that the term  "ergonomic minimalism" does the idea more justice.

"Minimalism" used as a categorization is loose, and used as a description without further explanation it is outright loaded. Originally, Minimalism was an abstract art movement that gained prominences among visual artists such as [Yves Klein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yves_Klein), [Donald Judd](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Judd) and [Frank Stella](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Stella) in the late 1960's. To these artists, "Minimalism" was the result, simply put, the act of minimalising was itself was the intended art.

</div>

Thelonious Monk heavily levereged "Minimalism", but in contrast to Klein, Monk used it as a process or a tool rather than as a result. Keep in mind that Monk reached his artistic peak during the early 1960's and as such was most likely unfamiliar with the formal movement of "Minimalism" within the visual arts. Nonetheless, Minimalism as a manifests itself within Monk's music through his use of dramatic silences and abrubt hesitations while playing. As an example of this, listen to Monk's composition "Thelonious", with special attention to his solos, where he improvises.

<div layout="horizontal" layout-align="space-around" style="padding: 22px 0px">

</div>

Monk solos on a moderate tempo, and at parts it sounds almost as if he forgets to play a note or two that would otherwise tie things together. The notes he does play are jagged, uneven, and sparse. In an era when his bebop contemporaries, such as John Coltrane, belonged to the order of blazing tempos and dense and virtuosic solos, Monk made made his mark on the musical landscape by playing with polar opposite techniques. Monk stripped away the flourishes and the flashy runs on the piano to distill his music to the bare essentials, to accentuate the importance of what remains.

Material Design applies Monk's minimalism, not Klein's, to the context of the user interface. Strip away all of the unnecessary parts and components of the interface and display only what the user needs to see or interact with at that moment in time. The extra parts, the chrome and the gilding, serve only to distract the user from the fundamental purpose of your product or application. 

As an example of Material minimalism, analyze again the example of the email application interface we saw earlier.

<div layout="horizontal" layout-align="space-around" class="image-container">
	<img ng-src="{{ getAssetsUrl() + 'material-color-2.png' }}" />
</div>

The singular, primary action here is to create a new email. This action is made obvious by the use of semantic, dissonant color that we discussed earlier, but also because it is the only point of interaction that has been made readily apparent. Lesser actions, like deletion and favoriting, that are typically promoted in an email application have instead been demoted or alltogether hidden away. Search, a tool for fine grained navigation, is easily accessible from within this context of emails. There is no potential for confusion about the purpose of this particular interface. Just like Monk, Material recognizes the power of distilling content to its bare essentials in order to highlight and draw importance to what remains.
