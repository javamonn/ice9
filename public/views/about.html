		I like to create things that people interact with. I believe that the fundamental goal guiding software development is to simultaneously enable, enrich, and simplify our lives. Programming is my career, my passion, and my art. I hack on a wide variety of things, but most of my time is devoted to full stack JavaScript and Android developent. I freelance, and open source most of my <a href="https://github.com/javamonn?tab=repositories">personal projects</a>.

		I have found that I learn most effectively through experience and application, and the <a href="/post/the_cat's_cradle">goal of this blog</a> is to futher solidify my understanding of topics and ideas through writing about these experiences. At the same time, I hope that my writings might further the reader's knowledge as well. Posts relating to software engineering will compose the bulk of the content, but I will also post about other topics that I enjoy learning about as well; namely art, literature, and math.
