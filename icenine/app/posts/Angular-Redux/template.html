  [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/index.html), a JavaScript library from Facebook used for building
  complex User Interfaces, has skyrocketed in popularity over the coarse of the last year and has effectively
  become the champion of front-end JavaScript. Using React effectively involves adhering to its architectural
  philosophy: Your application should be built with composable components backed by an immutable unidirectional
  data flow. View templates and the logic driving them are tightly coupled, and state local to individual components 
  should be avoided whenever possible. Components publish to [stores](https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/overview.html#stores) 
  to reflect changing application state. Components serving as [Controller-Views](https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/overview.html#views-and-controller-views) 
  will subscribe to changes on stores and trickle down these changes to sub-components, enabling stateful data to 
  follow a singlular direction down the tree of components composing the application.

  Angular touts itself as a ["Model-View-Whatever"](https://plus.google.com/+AngularJS/posts/aZNVhj355G2) framework but 
  the overwhelming majority of Angular applications are structured in a very tradional Model-View-Controller fashion. The 
  typical Angular application is structured as folowed:
  <ul>
    <li>
    Views and Controllers are <b>isolated from eachother but still tightly coupled</b>. Presentation logic is placed in
    usually large template files managed by a single controller that updates the model(s) as needed and occasionally houses
    presentation logic too large or complex to encapsulate in the template itself. Degree of coupling destroys any hope for
    true separation of concerns. 
    </li>
    <li>
    Directives are <b>typically reserved for encapsulation of DOM manipulation instead of as fully fledged components</b>.
    Angular developers are used to pulling in and using third party directives to provide pluggable bootstrap-like functionality,
    this is the core sharing mechanism of the Angular community, akin to Ruby gems. We use prebuilt directives as components througout
    the presentation layer as well - think <span class="code">ng-repeat</span> and <span>ng-if</span>. This is where the directive-as-componenent 
    concept within Angular stops, however. The primary building block of an Angular application is the monolithic Controller - used
    to manage the functionality of an entire View or route instead of splitting the driving logic across multiple composable directives.
    This is an easy trap to fall into: The Angular docs widely support the monolithic controller, and the dominant routing framework, ui-router,
    supports this paradigm as well.
    </li>
    <li>
    Two way data-binding is used to communicate state across directives and isolate scopes. Dependency graphs are difficult to reason
    about due to the same mutable state being accessed, handled, and updated in multiple places. Controllers are left to wrangle the
    most up to date and correct state from sub components and reflect it to the back end.
    </li>
    <li>
    Application services are a 1-to-1 to backend API endpoints, merely taking data and returning the server's response. There is no
    single source of truth of application state, merely that which has been persisted to the backend. 
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  The goal of the article is to walkthrough the development of an Angular application that makes a relatively large break in structure 
  from that of the typical Angular application in favor of employing an archetecture closer to what  React encourages. In doing so we will
  come to appreciate the versitility of Angular and embrace its true MVW nature, that is, it's still a framework, but you can use the 
  framework in whatever way you want.
