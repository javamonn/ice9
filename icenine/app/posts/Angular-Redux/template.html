  [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/index.html), a JavaScript library from Facebook used for building
  dynamic user interfaces, has enjoyed meteoric adoption rates and popularity since its initial release,
  driven by its performance and ease of use relative to that of other frameworks. React employs various
  methods to achieve this, including a [virtual DOM], [jsx], and inclination towards immutable data.
  </p> 
  <p>
  With React came [Flux], an application architecture pattern detailing how to handle data and respond
  to user events in web applications. Flux is an idea, not a library, and it is not specific to React.
  Flux applications are built with a tree of composable components, backed by an immutable unidirectional
  data flow. Components at the bottom act as individual UI controls, and publish to [stores](https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/overview.html#stores)
  to reflect changing application state, avoiding local state whenever possible. Components at the top of the 
  tree serve as [Controller-Views](https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/overview.html#views-and-controller-views), 
  listening to stores and propagating changes to interested sub-components.
  <p/>
  <p>
  Flux applications have implicit performance gains as a direct result of their structure. Stores, which model
  general application state instead of unique records, centralize network access thereby reducing redundant interactions
  with the API server. Stores serve as the application's single source of truth, circumventing the need to reconcile state 
  between the components themselves. Unidirectional dataflow enables selective re-rendering of only the components that
  have received updated data. Immutability reduces data compare operations to constant time, allowing for framework
  level hyper-optimizations: React will short circuit rendering operations, while Angular's fundamental $watch (which dirty-checks
  objects under the hood) will be much more performant by avoiding deep object property compares.
  </p> 
  <p>
  In addition to performance gains, Flux applications are simpler to reason about. A unidirectional dataflow dampens 
  complex component depedency graphs that inevitably result from the abuse of mechanisms like component-to-component
  broadcasts or two-way data binding; components are coupled to the structure of the flow of data instead of to
  eachother and are a function of the true application state as presented by the store rather than a piecemeal state 
  that may be inferred or reconciled from neighbors in varying stages of interaction with the API server.
  </p>
  <p>
  The existing guides and literature documenting Flux are almost universally targetted towards its use with React.
  There exist a multitude of mixins and supporting libraries that abstract away the boilerplate of integrating Flux
  and React. There is no reason that Flux and React should be married other than that they are both products of
  Facebook. The goal of this article is to demonstrate how one could apply a Flux architecture to a relatively 
  simple Angular application, the TodoMVC. The repository containing the finished code can be viewed [here]().
