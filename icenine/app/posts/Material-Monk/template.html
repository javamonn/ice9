  Coinciding with the release of <a href="http://www.android.com/versions/lollipop-5-0/">Android 5.0, Lollipop</a>,
  Google has engineered the <a href="http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html">Material Design</a>
  paradigm, a monolithic UX philosophy that aims to simplify and enlighten digital interactions. It has been met with mixed
  reactions from the design and front end engineering community, largely because it violates a lot of previously well
  established trends within interface and application design.

  <p>
  One important fact of Material has been largely unrecognized, that is, it is actually nothing new. Material itself is
  merely a formalized system, the core ideas that compose it have been employed by content creators in domains such
  as music, architecture, and literature with considerable success over the last century. These ideas applied within
  the context user experience are an entirely new idea and have the potential to be paradigm shifting, but it's
  important to realize that Material simply packages tried and tested techniques and philosophies with the intent of
  application to a new problem domain.
  </p>
  <p>
  This fact can be sufficiently demonstrated by drawing parallels between some of the "design" aspects evident in the
  music of the American Jazz pianist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelonious_Monk">Thelonious Sphere Monk</a>
  and some of the strategies encompassed by Google's Material. The simularities go deeper than just surface level,
  one can draw parallels between the techniques themselves, but also between the reasonings for why Monk and Material
  both chose to utilize a particular technique, and why it's effective in their respective domains.
  </p>
  <p>
  Monk is my choice used simply because I am familiar with his work, this is not to mean he is responsible for inception
  of these ideas. One could have just as easiy selected the architect
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Lloyd_Wright">Frank Lloyd Wright</a>or the poet
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._E._Cummings">E. E. Cummings</a> as their focus and resulted with some, if not
  just as many, meaningful comparisons.
  </p>
  <p>
  The goal is to facilitate a better understanding and appreciation of the core philosophies of Material Design, and
  maybe in turn, the music of Thelonious Monk.

  <h1>Colorful Dissonance</h1>

  <p>
  One of the core themes of Material is the unorthodox use of color, emphasizing jarring color juxtopositions througout
  the interface. The design documentation specifically encourages the introduction of "unexpected and vibrant color".
  Take a look at two of the application samples given in the documentation:
  </p>

  <div layout="horizontal" layout-align="space-around" class="image-container" id="material-plates">
    <img ng-src="{{ getAssetsUrl() + 'material-color-1.png' }}" />
    <img ng-src="{{ getAssetsUrl() + 'material-color-2.png' }}" />
  </div>

  <p>
  The first impression of these plates is one of surprise and a certain degree of confusion. The use of color here stands
  out and feels wrong. From the perspective of an interface designer, you wonder who would ever use a yellow accent on a 
  black background or strand a bright cyan fab button without tying it back into the app's color scheme. From the perspective 
  of a user, you feel shocked. Regardless of perspective, even though it breaks the rules in a certain sense, something 
  about the use of color in these interfaces jumps at you and captures your attention. The technical term 
  at the root of this phenomenon is ***dissonance***.
  </p>

  <blockquote cite="The American HeritageÂ® Dictionary of the English Language">

    <p>dissonance n.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>A harsh, disagreeable combination of sounds; discord.</li>
      <li>Lack of agreement, consistancy, or harmony; conflict.</li>
    </ol>

  </blockquote>
  <p>
  If you look into the history of the term <a href="https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=dissonance">dissonance</a> 
  you'll learn that even though the word has its origins in late Middle English, it sees a dramatic increase in 
  usage in the late 1950's through the 1960's, directly coinciding with the renaissance of jazz and the reign of 
  the "High Priest of Bebop", Thelonious Monk.
  <p>

  <p>
  Monk made heavy and regular use of dissonance within his compositions. His music, as did much of Bebop, required 
  careful listening to "get it", but his dissonant chords often left unitiated audiances and conservitive critics 
  surprised and confused. To Monk, his chords "were the product of years of training, experimentation, and a 
  solid understanding of music theory". To critics and fans, they seemed just "wrong" and "weird". As a good 
  example of Monk's approach to the piano and his command of dissonance, take a moment to consider this recording of 
  his composition "Off Minor".
  </p>

    <audio controls ng-src="{{ getAssetsUrl() + 'off-minor.mp3' }}">Your browser does not support audio!</audio>
  </div>

  <p>
  Without a doubt, the piano keys under Monk's hands seems to be a distant cousin of the keys touched by classical 
  composers like Chopin or even the piano as heard in most modern American music. A significant culpit for this 
  percieved distance lies in Monk's liberal use of dissonance, the use of chords and notes you did not expect to 
  hear in the places that you did not expect to hear them. Dissonance made his music take on different qualities 
  than that of the pianists to come before him, but also of all his Bebop contemporaries playing along side of him. 
  It enabled him to stand out artistically and critically.
  </p>

  <p>
  The results of dissonance transcend the domain in which it occurs, that is, the effects it has on the intended 
  audiance are largely the same whether it is employed within music, as Monk used it, or within design, as Material 
  uses it. Surprising someone will always captivate them, that is a universal rule of the human brain. Dissonance 
  captures attention and forms memories of the experience precisely because it is percieved to be wrong or unconventional.
  </p>

  <p>
  Material leverages color dissonance and it's effects to elevate the percieved importance of certain parts of the user 
  interface. The first components the user naturally notices about the interface samples we saw above were the components 
  with dissonant colors: the yellow slider and the cyan fab button. Immediately, without any other knowledge of what this 
  application does, the dissonant color of these components allow the user to *infer* their importance to this interface. 
  Dissonance implies meaning, and color becomes semantic.
  </p>

  <p>
  The use of color in this fashion is antithetical to how color is used in modern web and application design, where minimal 
  color contrast and flat theming is king. Color palletes are composed of similar hues, font colors are barely legible on 
  their backgrounds, and the goal is a sterile, smooth, and "modern" interface. Examples of these trends can be seen on 
  the landing pages of <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a>, <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> 
  and <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a>. Examples within the worlds of iOS and Android are even more abundant. 
  The issues plaguing this type of theming range from discrimination against atechnical users and users impaired vision, 
  to the simple fact that interfaces are leaving a lot of potential utility on the table by not using dissonance as a tool.
  <p>

  <p>
  Admittedly, utilizing color dissonance is, by its very nature, uncomfortable to do. It feels like you're breaking fundamental 
  rules of design, and in some perspectives, you are. It's a gut feeling to get it right and easily taken too far into 
  disjointed chaos. The influence of all the sterile and low contrast sites we use on a daily basis are subtly imprinted on our 
  subconcious, and manifested in our work. The one advantage that we have, that Monk didn't, is the knowledge, the evidence of retrospect, 
  that dissonance is effective as a creative tool.
  </p>

  <h1>Ergonomic Minimalism</h1>

  <p>
  Another core philosophy of Material Design is the idea of reducing interface clutter and unneeded components ("chrome") to just 
  what is necessary to enable fundamental purpose of that particular interface. This concept is referenced in the Material Design 
  documents as "deliberate whitespace", but I feel that the term "ergonomic minimalism" is much more truthful to what this theme 
  fully entails.
  </p>

  <p>
  "Minimalism" used as a method of categorization is a blunt tool, and used as a description without further explanation it is 
  outright disingenuous. In modern parlance, you'll see and hear minimalism used to describe almost anything. Low contrast design 
  themes have been pawned off and rationalized as being "minimalistic" more than once. Minimalism has more to do with what you 
  choose to and choose not to present, rather than the specifics of how you present it.
  </p>

  <p>
  Originally, the term minimalism was used to describe an abstract art movement that gained prominences among visual artists such 
  as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yves_Klein">Yves Klein</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Judd">Donald Judd</a>
  and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Stella">Frank Stella</a> in the late 1960's. To these artists, "Minimalism" was 
  the result, simply put, the act of minimalising was itself was the intended art.
  </p>

  <div class="image-container" layout="row" layout-align="space-around" ice-attribution="Yves Klein, IKB 191, 1962.">
    <img ng-src="{{ getAssetsUrl() + 'klein-monochrome.jpg' }}"></img>
  </div>

  <p>
  Thelonious Monk heavily levereged minimalism, but in contrast to Klein, Monk used it as a process or a tool rather than as a result. 
  Keep in mind that Monk reached his artistic peak during the early 1960's and as such was most likely unfamiliar with the formal movement 
  of minimalism within the visual arts. Themes of minimalism manifest themselves within Monk's music through his use of dramatic silences and 
  abrubt hesitations while playing. Monk deliberately chose not to play notes at the times when others would have, earning him the description 
  from one critic as "the elephant on the keyboard". As an example of this, listen to Monk's composition "Thelonious", with special attention 
  to his solos, where he improvises.
  </p>

  <div layout="row" layout-align="space-around" style="padding: 22px 0px">
    <audio controls ng-src="{{ getAssetsUrl() + 'thelonious.mp3' }}">Your browser does not support audio!</audio>
  </div>

  <p>
  Monk solos on a moderate tempo, and at parts it sounds almost as if he forgets to play a note or two that would otherwise tie things 
  together. The notes he does play are jagged, uneven, and sparse. In an era when his bebop contemporaries, such as John Coltrane, 
  belonged to the order of blazing tempos and dense and virtuosic solos, Monk made made his mark on the musical landscape by playing with 
  polar opposite techniques. Monk stripped away the flourishes, the filler notes, and the flashy runs on the piano to distill his music 
  to the bare essentials, to accentuate the importance of what remains.
  </p>

  <p>
  Material Design is an adherent of Monk's concept of Minimalism, not Klein's. Interfaces are tools, and the best tools are purposefully 
  designed to do only a single thing well. In addition to interfaces that try to be too utilitarian, theres a lot of cruft and chrome that 
  go along with the typical interface that don't contribute to its central purpose and have no logical reason to be there. By demoting the 
  secondary or trivial aspects of an interface, you increase the clarity of the purpose of the components that are left.
  </p>

  <p>
  As an example of Material minimalism, analyze again the example of the email application interface we saw earlier.
  </p>

  <div layout="row" layout-align="space-around" class="image-container">
    <img ng-src="{{ getAssetsUrl() + 'material-color-2.png' }}" />
  </div>

  <p>
  The singular, primary action here is to create a new email. This action is made obvious by the use of semantic, dissonant color that we 
  discussed earlier, but also because it is the only point of interaction that has been made readily apparent. Lesser actions, like favoriting,
  that are typically promoted in an email application have instead been demoted via duller color contrasts or completely hidden away, 
  accessible from a separate interface.
  </p>

  <p>
  There is no potential for confusion about the purpose of this particular interface. Just like Monk, Material recognizes the power of distilling 
  content to its bare essentials in order to highlight and draw importance to what remains.
  </p>

  <h1>Retrospect</h1>

  <p>
  Of course, isolating these particular components of the playing style of Thelonious Monk and identifying them as the embodiment of good design 
  is simple to do when we're working backwards from Google's Material Design documentation. Nonetheless, these parallels still exist, and we can 
  identify more of the design philosophies that Material encourages within the works of other artists, writers, architects, and creative people.
  </p>

  <p>
  Material's greatest strength lies in the recognition that the ideas fundamental to good design are universal. The medium of content consumption 
  may differ, but the content consumers themselves largely stay the same. Dissonance and minimalism have a particular set of effects of those that 
  perceive them, regardless of whether they are used within music or within interface design. The challenge is determining how to best introduce 
  effects like these within the given medium. Material Design provides us, as designers and front end engineers, some good inspiration for ways 
  to leverage some of these effects. But inspiration is not canon.
  </p>

    "You're taught to play a piano a certain way, and if you don't play it that way, it's not the correct way. Without saying a word, Monk taught me, 'Play what you feel although it may not be the way it's supposed to be."
