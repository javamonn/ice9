I like to create things that people interact with. I believe that the fundamental goal guiding software development is to simultaneously enable, enrich, and simplify our lives. Programming is my career, my passion, and my art. I hack on a wide variety of things, but most of my time is devoted to full stack JavaScript and Android developent. I freelance, and open source most of my [personal projects](https://github.com/javamonn?tab=repositories), including the [code that runs this website](https://github.com/javamonn/ice9).

Ice-nine is a fictional substance crafted by Kurt Vonnegut, used as a plot device in his novel Cat's Cradle. Although physically an element of science fiction, the idea behind the substance is very real. To me, it forms a metaphor for the process of self-education, of learning, and of experience. ice-nine derives its special properties from its **seed**, the "crystal pattern" that governs how the atoms organize and structure themselves. I am driven by the constant desire to learn and to better myself, that is my nucleus, that is my seed. The code I craft and the words I write are the result of this **seed** crystalizing itself upon contact with the external world. It is a perpetual, unstoppable process, just like ice-nine.

I have found that I learn most effectively through experience and application, and the intent of this blog is to futher solidify my understanding of topics and ideas through writing about these experiences. At the same time, I hope that my writings might further the reader's knowledge as well. Posts covering and relating to software engineering will compose the bulk of the content, but I will also post about other topics that I enjoy learning about as well; namely art, literature, and math.
